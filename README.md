# Conceptual Redesign of Critical Components for Palisades Nuclear Power Plant Restart (2025)

## 📜 Project Overview
This project presents a conceptual AutoCAD redesign of key safety and operational components for the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant, inspired by its planned restart in 2025 after decommissioning in 2022.

I focused on imagining structural and safety enhancements in critical areas:
- Steam generator redesign and containment upgrades
- Emergency cooling system optimization
- Control room modernization for advanced monitoring
- Perimeter safety and seismic protection zones

## 🛠 Key Features
- Detailed AutoCAD drawings showcasing floor layouts and system components
- Visual renders and diagrams for better design explanation
- PDF summaries highlighting safety considerations and design rationale
- Integration of trending industrial topics: sustainability, automation, and safety

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **dwg_files/** — AutoCAD DWG files for each system  
- **renders/** — Visual images, concept diagrams, and 3D views  
- **project_docs/** — PDF documentation and safety reports  

## 💡 Why this project?
With Palisades Nuclear Power Plant’s restart in the news (as covered by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/)), this conceptual project allowed me to:
- Practice industrial-scale design thinking  
- Explore critical safety layouts and redundancy planning  
- Align my work with trending real-world engineering challenges  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- AutoCAD 2025  
- Reference research from NRC documents and public news  
- Render processing using AutoCAD and visualization tools  

## 📸 Screenshots (to be added)
- ✅ Steam Generator Conceptual Layout  
- ✅ Control Room Mockup and Safety Systems  

## 📚 Key Learnings
- The complexity of layered safety systems in nuclear facilities  
- Importance of redundancy and emergency response paths  
- The power of working on real-world, trending projects for skill building
